/* NAME: gpfs_init_watch
 *
 * FUNCTION: The gpfs_init_watch subroutine initializes a watch and returns a
 *           parent watch descriptor (pwd). The gpfs_init_watch subroutine
 *           checks if you have enabled watch folder. It also checks if you
 *           will exceed the maximum number of watches per file system (25).
 *
 *           If you have not enabled watch folder functionality, gpfs_init_watch
 *           will fail. If you already have 100 watches on your cluster for all
 *           file systems combined, gpfs_init_watch will fail.
 *
 *           Note: The parent watch descriptor and the child watch descriptors
 *           are not Linux file descriptors. For example, one cannot poll the
 *           descriptors.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: void
 *
 * RETURNS: The gpfs_init_watch subroutine returns the pwd on success or -1 on
 *           failure.
 *
 * Errno: Errno is set if -1 is returned.
 *        ENOKEY
 *            Watch folder is not enabled. Check with IBM Spectrum Scale™
 *            support to enable it.
 *        EINTR
 *            Maximum number of watches were exceeded on this cluster. The
 *            maximum number of watches allowed per cluster is 100.
 *        Note: Further errnos might be reported depending on the inner
 *              instrumentation of the API. Use gpfs_watch_strerror to learn
 *              more about an error.
 *
 * EXAMPLES: For an example using gpfs_*_watch,
 *           see /usr/lpp/mmfs/samples/util/tswf.C.

/* NAME: gpfs_add_watch
 *
 * FUNCTION: The gpfs_add_watch subroutine watches files in the folder
 *           specified by pathname. The watch is non-recursive like
 *           Linux inotify. This means that the contents in subdirectories
 *           under the watched directory are not watched. The gpfs_add_watch
 *           subroutine registers your intention to watch said folder. In
 *           addition, it also verifies if the file system that you want to
 *           watch is owned by the local cluster. Currently, watches over
 *           file systems mounted on an accessing cluster are not supported.
 *

 * PARAMETERS:
